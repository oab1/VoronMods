Modified existing v2.2 exhaust housing to incorporate u/0ndsk4's Nevermore Micro Duo:
- Uses the same 2 5015 Blower fans and 4mm activated carbon pellets. 
- Two holes need to be cut into the back panel (1.5" diameter) for the blower fan inlets. 
- The housing works as a good cutting template once it is printed. 
- Housing attaches to back panel with VHB tape
- Removable drawer as a filter basket to hold carbon pellets for filtration.
- Incorporated fitting for bowden tube from v2.4 (1/8" BSP adapter)

I recommend printing the housing with at least 3 perimeters and about 15% infill. More infill than that is pretty overkill.

## Hardware needed:
- 2x 5015 blower fans (confirmed fitment with Winsin brand, but same as used in nevermore micro)
- 4x 6x3mm magnet (same as used in V2 BOM)
- 6x M3x5x4 heatset inserts
- 4x m3 screws (6-8mm length OK)
- 3M VHB tape
- Approx 200g of 4mm activated carbon pellets, I bought mine here:
