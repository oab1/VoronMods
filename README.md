# V2 Exhaust
![picture](Images/1.PNG)

Added new re-circulating exhaust fan to standard V2 rear location. Based on V2.2 exhaust housing modified to include u/0ndsk4's Nevermore micro design, with some minor tweaks.

Uses the same 2 5015 Blower fans, and 4mm activated carbon pellets. Two holes need to be cut into the back panel (1.5" diameter) for the blower inlets. The housing works as a good template. Housing attaches to back panel with VHB tape, same as v2.2/2.4 designs. Pellets need to be replaced every so often, have heard anywhere from 50-100 hours. Have not run that long myself yet.

## Hardware needed:
- 2x 5015 blower fans (confirmed fitment with Winsin brand, but same as used in nevermore micro)
- 4x 6x3mm magnet (same as used in V2 BOM)
- 6x M3x5x4 heatset inserts
- 4x m3 screws (6-8mm length OK)
- 3M VHB tape
- Approx 200g of 4mm activated carbon pellets, I bought mine here:
