# VoronMods
My modifications to the Voron v2 printer live here. 

Added new re-circulating exhaust fan to standard V2 rear location. Based on V2.2 exhaust housing modified to include u/0ndsk4's Nevermore micro design, with some minor tweaks.

Uses 2 5015 Blower fans, and 4mm activated carbon pellets. The filter basket can be slightly larger since it is not restricted to fitting underneath the bed,
however I did have to add two holes to the back panel for the blower inlet. Pellets need to be replaced every so often, have heard anywhere from 50-100 hours. Have not run that long myself yet.

## Hardware needed:
- 2x 5015 blower fans (confirmed fitment with Winsin brand, but same as used in nevermore micro)
- 4x 6x3mm magnet (same as used in V2 BOM)
- 4x M3x5x4 heatset inserts
- 4x m3 screws (6-8mm length OK)
- Approx 200g of 4mm activated carbon pellets, I bought mine here:

## Nevermore micro:
